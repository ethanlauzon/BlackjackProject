# BlackjackProject

## Description
This application simulates playing blackjack. You can hit or stay. If you go over
21 then you lose and the terminal prints out a you lose message. If you get higher
than the dealer, you win. If the dealer gets less than 17 then he hits automatically.
If he is more than 17, he stays. If both the dealer and the player both get 21 then
the program outputs that you got a tie.

##Technologies Used
git, atom, eclipse, terminal
## Lessons Learned
I learned how to use objects properly within java, such as calling calling objects
from different classes and instantiating new objects of classes. I improved my use of different
loops, such as the switch/case loop, if loop, and while loops. I learned how to trouble shoot problems and test if methods are being called correctly. I also used && and || conditions for the first time, so I was able to figure out when to use the appropriate conditions. This program was the first time I had used enums to assign values to the various cards within my deck. This was also my first time for using an abstract class so that I could use it across my various different classes. In this project I also used comments to keep track of my thinking for my different loops and conditions.
